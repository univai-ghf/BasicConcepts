# Overfitting and Regularization: Basic Concepts of Machine Learning

This workshop has 2 aims. It (a)aims to introduce the basic concepts of machine learning and (b)utilize these concepts in choosing a machine learning model.

The basic problem with models that are too complex in machine earning is that they are not robust. This is called over-fitting. We will see two ways to fix this: choosing a model of an appropriate complexity, called *complexity control*, or choose a very complex model to begin with and restrict this model's parameters to a subset of their allowed values, called *regularization*.

In both these approaches, there are hyper-parameters whose values must be set. And these values are determined on sets called validation sets, while the fitting is done on the training set, for reasons we shall see.
