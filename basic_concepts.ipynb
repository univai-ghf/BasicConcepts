    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn is the main python machine learning library. It consists of many learners which can learn models from data, as well as a lot of utility functions such as `train_test_split`. It can be used in python by the incantation `import sklearn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library has a very well defined interface. This makes the library a joy to use, and surely contributes to its popularity. As the [scikit-learn API paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.0238v1.pdf) [Buitinck, Lars, et al. \"API design for machine learning software: experiences from the scikit-learn project.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1309.0238 (2013).] says:\n",
    "\n",
    ">All objects within scikit-learn share a uniform common basic API consisting of three complementary interfaces: **an estimator interface for building and ﬁtting models, a predictor interface for making predictions and a transformer interface for converting data**. The estimator interface is at the core of the library. It deﬁnes instantiation mechanisms of objects and exposes a `fit` method for learning a model from training data. All supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms (e.g., for classiﬁcation, regression or clustering) are oﬀered as objects implementing this interface. Machine learning tasks like feature extraction, feature selection or dimensionality reduction are also provided as estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the \"estimator\" interface here, specifically the estimator `PolynomialFeatures`. The API paper again:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Since it is common to modify or ﬁlter data before feeding it to a learning algorithm, some estimators in the library implement a transformer interface which deﬁnes a transform method. It takes as input some new data X and yields as output a transformed version of X. Preprocessing, feature selection, feature extraction and dimensionality reduction algorithms are all provided as transformers within the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with we have one **feature** `x` to predict `y`, what we will do is the transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x \\rightarrow 1, x, x^2, x^3, ..., x^d $$\n",
    "\n",
    "for some power $d$. Our job then is to **fit** for the coefficients of these features in the polynomial\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ... + a_d x^d. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we have transformed a function of one feature, into a (rather simple) **linear** function of many features. To do this we first construct the estimator as `PolynomialFeatures(d)`, and then transform these features into a d-dimensional space using the method `fit_transform`.\n",
